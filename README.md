# What is KYC

The main process behind KYC is that government and enterprises need to track the customers for illegal and money laundering activities. Moreover, KYC also enable banks to better understand their customers and their financial dealings. This helps them manage their risks and make better decisions.

# Need for KYC

Taking in from the origin of KYC, we can state that there are four major sectors in banking where KYC is needed:

Customer Admittance: Making anonymous accounts as restricted entry into the banking system. Preliminary information such as names, birth dates, addresses, contact numbers are to be collected to provide banking service.

Customer Identification: In the case of suspicious banking transactions through a customer, the customer accounts can be tracked and flagged. Further, it can send to process under the bank head office for review.

Monitoring of Bank Activities: Suspicious and doubtful activities in any account can be zeroed in by the bank after understanding its customer base using KYC.

Risk Management: Now that bank has all the preliminary information and activity pattern, it can assess the risk and the likelihood of the customer being involved in illegal transactions.
